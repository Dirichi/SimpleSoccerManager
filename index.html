  <h1 id="title">Simple Soccer Manager  </h1>
  
  <p>
  	This is a different type of soccer video game. First off it's 2D so that's boring. But wait. It's voice controlled. Yes you read right, voice controlled. And it's got some sentiment analysis in there too. Basically you give your team a command with the keyword team, followed by said command, e.g.

  </p>

  <p>
  	Team Attack
  </p>

  <p>This first instruction gets the game going. After that, you get to say anything you can to motivate the team</p>
  <p>e.g. Team You're awesome!</p>
  <p>If what you say is deemed positive, we increment your team's morale. If not, the game decrements it. Give it a go now!</p>
