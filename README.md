# SimpleSoccerManager
### This was supposed to be a soccer manager game but is turning out to be something else...

-  This is becoming a multiplayer online football game enabled with voice controls and sentiment analysis. 

-  In final form users will get on any of the games currently being played at the time or join an already existing, unfinished game. 

- users will not control an entire team, as with regular games, but will control a single player

-  Users improve their team morale or the morale of specific players on the team by saying positive things. messages 
determined to be negative will reduce team morale and performance as well. 

-  If you wanna run this and work on it locally 
   -  first install NodeJs if you havent't, 
   -  clone the repo,
   -  cd to the directory where it's stored
   -  run npm install
   -  if no errors, run node app.js
   -  direct your chrome browser to localhost:3000
   -  get crackalacking!
   -  **NB: this game currently only works on chrome, and is not really enabled for mobile**
